# üîë Python Password Manager 

Hi there! I'm **codenik7**. This is my first attempt at a functional project in Python.

This project is a simple command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to manage and secure your passwords locally on your machine. While it may seem "short-handed," it took significant effort to handle the underlying logic for file I/O and data persistence‚Äîa process that helped me learn a ton about Python fundamentals!

## ‚ú® Project Features

This application performs three core functions:

1.  **Suggest and Save:** Generates a strong, random password for a specified platform and saves the entry to a local `password.txt` file.
2.  **Search:** Retrieves and copies a saved password to the clipboard based on the platform and username.
3.  **Delete:** Deletes a specific password entry from the file (using the **Read, Filter, Overwrite** method).

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

1.  **Prerequisites:** You need Python 3 installed and the `pyperclip` library.
    ```bash
    pip install pyperclip
    ```
2.  **Execution:**
    ```bash
    python your_file_name.py 
    # (Replace your_file_name.py with the actual name of your script)
    ```
3.  Follow the prompts in the terminal to choose an option (1, 2, or 3).

## üôè Acknowledgments & Feedback

I'm a **complete beginner** on this programming journey, and I‚Äôm eager to learn. If you notice any security flaws, inefficiencies, or general coding mistakes, please don't hesitate to let me know!
